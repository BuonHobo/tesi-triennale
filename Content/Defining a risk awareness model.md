- How are people making robots safe right now?
    - Hierarchy of risk reduction
        - elimination
        - substitution
        - safeguarding
        - personal protection equipment
        - awareness
    - Risk factors
        - These are shown in the RIA pdf
        - Mention the ISO, RIA and ANSI standards
        - Avoidance,
        - severity,
        - exposure
    - Changing shape of robot (or compliant robot)
    - Putting barriers
    - Reallocating responsibilities
    - Sensors
        - Reaction to sensor data
        - Slow down, stop (bad for efficiency)
- These are mostly design guidelines.
    - We can’t easily apply them to an existing HRC
        - they are about the shape, role and safety measures
    - Or if we can, it’s not sophisticated
        - It’s just a slowdown or a stop, or keeping distance
        - Safety stops can be frequent since there is no way to plan with safety in mind
        - Estimated safety parameters prior to execution
            - They make the designers be over conservative
    - Some of them decrease collaboration
        - In the name of safety, some task are never done collaboratively
        - might be because of the application of those design patterns
        - might be because of the application of the not sophisticated runtime techniques
    - We need a better plan-time and run-time solution
- We want a new risk awareness model
    - It should be general
    - It should be flexible
    - It should be based on a preexisting and tested standard
- How we morph the “design patterns” into a flexible, general model
    - Morph design time severity into plan time (or run time) severity
        - General risk of the scenario becomes a risk value for each task
        - It is intrinsic to the task itself, not how it is carried out
            - Which tool
                - Shape
                - Powered?
            - What power
            - What weight
            - impact type
            - impact strength
    - Morph design time avoidance into …
        - General avoidance considerations become values that describe the movement of robot and human
        - We can use the knowledge how robot and human position
        - robot and human speed
        - Uncertainty of human movement
    - Morph design time exposure …
        - This is about the morphology of the collaborative environment
            - barriers
            - protective equipment
        - Since it’s meant to reduce impact probability, we can just use that
        - This is where the awareness of which tasks are being executed comes into play
        - High exposure means that robot and human are working closely or in highly collaborative tasks
        - Tasks that are far away or less collaborative have less exposure
