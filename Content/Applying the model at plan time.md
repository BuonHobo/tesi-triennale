- Parameters interpretation
    - Values are pre-computed or estimated
    - Impact probability is the closeness of tasks
    - Human uncertainty is the expertise level of the human
- Making it efficient
    - Deriving Makespan
        - Deriving makespan from geometry, speed and assigned task
        - Makespan can also use heuristics such as human expertise and collision probability
    - Using Pareto optimization
    - If we don’t know what the human is doing yet, we can use heuristics
- Advantages of this solution
    - It can be tightly integrated with PLATINUm’s planning process
    - It provides PLATINUm with a form of risk awareness that can be used along with metrics
    - The robot can take the human’s experience level into account
- Disadvantages
    - The plan-time version can require a lot of pre-compiled data about the tasks
- Other work that can be done
    - Robot-Human communication when plan time risk is too high
    - Guidelines or automated tools for compiling data could be worked on
