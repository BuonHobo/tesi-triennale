- Parameters interpretation
    - Intrinsic risk is the same
    - Geometry risk and Movement speed are real time
    - Human uncertainty and Impact probability is real time (sensor data)
- Hard to use real time data, but it allows great control over safety
    - Robot motion data (like geometry and speed) can be adjusted in real time
    - Human motion data can also be adjusted
        - Signaling danger to the human
            - lights, sound, voice
        - Changing the human task
- Hard limits to risk can be set
- A lot of configuration possibilities with presets
- Hard to use sensor data. The technology might not even be there yet
- Movement override when runtime risk is too high
