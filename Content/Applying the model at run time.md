- Parameters interpretation
    - Intrinsic risk is the same
    - Geometry risk and Movement speed are real time
    - Human uncertainty and Impact probability is real time (sensor data)
- Hard to use real time data, but it allows great control over safety
    - Robot motion data (like geometry and speed) can be adjusted in real time
    - Human motion data can also be adjusted
        - Signaling danger to the human
            - lights, sound, voice
        - Changing the human task
- Hard limits to risk can be set
- A lot of configuration possibilities with presets
- Hard to use sensor data. The technology might not even be there yet
- Movement override when runtime risk is too high

## Interpreting the parameters

The 5 risk factors from the proposed method are fairly easy to apply to run time implementations of the model. All it takes is some further interpretation of what each parameter means by defining ways to calculate it and ways to influence it to reduce risk.

Just like we discussed earlier, the intrinsic risk value depends on the task that is being carried out at a given time and it does not depend on how it is being carried out. This means that
