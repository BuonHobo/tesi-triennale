- We also made some support PowerPoint presentations
    - DiapTirocinio
    - DiapEsperiemento
    - DiapGrafici

While working on this project, we also made some relevant support material in the form of pdf presentations. This small chapter is intended to briefly describe the support material available [at this address](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sW84-aIim4SFl8XDPiNp3gIzhk_kixfU?usp=sharing).
These documents were useful to us during the development phases and will probably be useful to other researchers looking into HRC safety.

## The model
During the research phases that we went through when defining a new model, we made a document explaining the main ideas behind our model, the significance of each of the parameters and ideas for runtime and plantime implementations. This presentation also includes the main advantages and disadvantages of our proposed method.
