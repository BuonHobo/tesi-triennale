- Explanation of the five risk values
    - What they mean
        - Intrinsic risk
            - what tool/payload?
                - hot
                - powered
                - sharp
                - heavy
            - what kind of robot?
                - compliant
                - pointy parts
                - fine grained control
            - Is there any protective equipment?
                - gloves, glasses, etc
            - Force or pressure?
        - Geometry risk
            - Could the robot hit a human by following this trajectory?
            - Which part?
        - Movement speed
            - How fast is the robot moving?
        - Impact probability
            - How close is the robot to the human?
            - What is the human doing?
        - Human uncertainty
            - How experienced is the human?
            - How much is he moving?
            - How experienced is he?
            - Is he aware of the robot?
    - (0,1] interval, but could be changed
    - Heuristics can be done when we donâ€™t know impact probability or human uncertainty
    - Each one of these values can be modified in some way
        - We have agency over the risk of the situation
- Qualities
    - It can be applied anywhere
    - Parameters can be reinterpreted to better fit a given scenario
    - Can reduce the amount of safety stops and slow downs
    - The robot can be more careful when working with unexperienced people
    - Can be fine tuned, although not very easily
        - Guidelines or automated tools for fine tuning could be worked on

## The 5 risk factors
We propose a model consisting of 5 risk factors that describe the safety characteristics of an HRC cell, thus giving collaborative robots a sophisticated risk awareness

### What they are
The intrinsic risk value is the direct translation of the severity concept. It is a value that represents how risky a given task is. The r
