- Actual simulations of the plan could be run with ROS in order to show that avoiding collision is powerful
- Work could be done to make the planner more reactive to the experience level of the human
- Experiments could be tried with more than one human, maybe with different experience level
- Experiment with the possibility of idling for more than a unit of time
    - Idling as a way to avoid risk
