## AI Planning

In today's rapidly evolving world, the ability to automate decision-making processes and plan complex actions is of paramount importance. Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning has emerged as a subfield of AI that addresses this need. AI planning focuses on generating plans or sequences of actions to accomplish predefined objectives. It involves constructing a plan that transforms an initial state of a system into a desired goal state. AI planning algorithms utilize domain knowledge and search techniques to efficiently explore the space of possible plans and identify the most optimal or feasible solution.

The process of AI planning involves several key components. Firstly, the representation of states, actions, and goals provides a formal framework for describing the problem domain. States represent the different configurations of the system, actions capture the atomic units of change that transform one state to another, and goals specify the desired end-state to be achieved. Secondly, the planning algorithm utilizes search techniques to traverse the space of possible states and actions, aiming to find a sequence of actions that satisfies the specified goals. The algorithm may employ heuristic functions to guide the search process efficiently. Ultimately, AI planning produces a plan, which is a sequence of actions that, when executed, achieves the desired goals.
