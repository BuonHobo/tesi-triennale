- Extending Planner
    - decorators
    - configurations
- Extending SearchStrategy
    - enqueue
    - compare
    - Domain specific object
- The NodeRiskPlanner Class
    - Platinumâ€™s flexibility allows to make a planner just by adding a class
- The RiskAssessmentSearchStrategy Class
    - A strategy affects the way a planner gets to the solution
    - The trivial safe solution is to avoid collaboration entirely
    - Pareto logic
- RiskSearchStrategy Class
    - Risk only
- MakespanSearchStrategy Class
    - dumb makespan only
- PlannerSearchStrategy Class
    - no risk awareness
    - already implemented
    - depth first
- Risk parameters as Java Enums
    - FromString constructor
    - Easy interface with platinum
- The NodeRiskEvaluator Class
    - Can be used by any planning strategy
    - Parses the whole plan into sequences of risk aware tasks
    - The risk factor of each robot task uses the weighted average of the parallel human tasks
    - All the data it produces:
        - average risk
        - max risk
        - possible collisions
        - best makespan
        - human makespan
        - best robot makespan
        - estimated robot makespan
        - robot tasks
        - human tasks
    - Evaluates Risk
    - Evaluates Makespan
- The python ddl generator
    - Flexible and easy to configure
        - more kinds of tasks
        - tweak amount of tasks
        - tweak allocation constraints
        - tweak trajectories, speeds and risk values
    - Modular
- The DataCollector Class
    - Start it and leave it
    - Get a detailed css
        - it collects time to plan
- The python chart generator
    - Define a set of functions, each one makes a graph
    - Just upload the css file and it automatically generates graphs
