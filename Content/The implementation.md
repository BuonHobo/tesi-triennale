## Integrating with PLATINUm
### PLATINUm's architecture
As stated earlier, and in [[Timeline-based planning and execution with uncertainty. Theory, modeling methodologies and practice]], PLATINUm is a general-purpose framework for planning and execution with timelines under uncertainty, which implements a hierarchical solving procedure.
The PLATINUm framework has a layered architecture, which consists of two main components: the Representation Framework and the Problem Solving component.

The Representation Framework is responsible for representing the planning domain and problem in a structured manner. It consists of a plan database that stores information about the planning domain, such as state variables, decomposition rules, and synchronization rules. The plan database is structured in such a way that it can support hierarchical modeling of timeline-based domains.

The Problem Solving component is responsible for generating plans that satisfy the given planning goals. It consists of a planner that uses search heuristics to leverage the hierarchical structure of the planning domain during plan generation. The planner is capable of dealing with temporal uncertainty during plan generation by leveraging information about the temporal uncertainty of the planning domain. This layer works in conjunction with the Representation Framework to support hierarchical modeling and solving of timeline-based planning problems under uncertainty. 

The planner uses the information stored in the plan database, such as state variables, decomposition rules, and synchronization rules. It's aim is to synthesize a set of operations that, given an initial state, allow the system to reach a desired goal state. The reasoning process relies on a model which represents a general description of the problem to solve. The model provides a representation of the environment in terms of the possible states of the world and the actions the system can perform to interact with the environment.

Suitable plans are found through the use of a Search Strategy class, which determines how the planner explores the space of possible solutions in order to find a plan that achieves the desired goal state. The choice of search strategy can have a significant impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of the planning process. There are many search strategies that can be used by planners, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some common search strategies include depth-first search, breadth-first search, best-first search, and iterative deepening search. The choice of search strategy depends on factors such as the size and complexity of the problem space, the available computational resources, and the desired trade-off between speed and optimality.

### Building on top of PLATINUm
In order to expand PLATINUm's capabilities with the ones provided by our model, we had to extend the two very important classes that were mentioned above: namely the Planner class and the SearchStrategy class.

PLATINUm's high degree of flexibility allowed us to make a new RiskAssessmentPlanner class very easily. The steps to make it work were configuring the Planner's modules using decorators. To be more specific, we configured the RiskAssessmentPlanner to have no planning timeout. This allows the Planner to keep looking for solutions for an unlimited amount of time. This was necessary because, as we'll explain later in the paper, the time to find a suitable plan can be quite high.
The other significant configuration step in RiskAssessmentPlanner was setting its search strategy to be our own RiskAssessmentSearchStrategy.

The RiskAssessmentSearchStrategy is one of the most essential parts of this project, since it is where some of the most crucial algorithmic parts of the implementation reside. The RiskAssessmentSearchStrategy expands the SearchStrategy class, and in order for it to work as we intend it to, we had to override some methods.

The first method we had to override was the `void enqueue(SearchSpaceNode node)` function. This function is responsible for receiving a partial plan and use it to make a wide variety of estimations about it. These estimations can be used later by the `int compare(SearchSpaceNode searchSpaceNode1, SearchSpaceNode searchSpaceNode2)` function to establish which partial plan the Problem Solving Component should consider to be better. The better node will be further refined and compared again with other partial plans, until a suitable plan is found.

The data that `enqueue` evaluates about a partial plan is then set as that node's `Object domainSpecificMetric` attribute, so that it can be later referenced in the `compare` function to establish which plan is preferred.

In our case, the `enqueue` function asks a different class to compute the relevant data and set it as the `domainSpecificMetric` attribute. We will elaborate on that different class in a moment.
The `enqueue` function also has the crucial role of computing the Heuristic Cost of a node, which is relevant during the comparison because it allows us to distinguish unrefined partial plans from more refined ones.
When all of this is done, the RiskAssessmentSearchStrategy gives the node back to PLATINUm, so that more operations can be done with it.

We want to stress that the `compare` function is the core of what distinguishes different Planners or Search Strategies, and the quality of results depends almost completely on it. As well as the time that it takes to find a suitable plan.
We will elaborate on what the `compare` function does later, after properly explaining which data our implementation computes and how. However, we can still make some considerations.
This function uses a Pareto optimization to find the best possible tradeoff between safety and efficiency. This kind of logic was needed to avoid trivial and extreme solutions which decrease risk by completely removing any degree of collaboration between human and robot. 
It is easy to find a safe plan where the robot does everything and the human watches from a safe distance, but this defeats all advantages of HRC.

As a way to showcase the qualities of our RiskAssessmentPlanner and RiskAssessmentSearchStrategy against less sophisticated solutions, we implemented other classes:
A RiskPlanner and RiskSearchStrategy which only compare partial plans based on the risk value, and a MakespanPlanner and MakespanSearchStrategy which only compare partial plans based on their expected makespan.
We also compared our strategy against the PlannerSearchStrategy, which is provided by PLATINUm and performs a blind depth first search. It has no awareness of the risk factors and makespan and only cares about finding the first suitable plan.

## Model implementation
### Risk factors
In order to evaluate the risk factors of a task, and subsequently of a whole plan, we need to know which tasks PLATINUm is proposing for the current partial plan. Each `SearchSpaceNode` has a reference to a `Plan` class, which in turn has a `Map<DomainComponent, List<DecisionVariable>>`. Each component in the problem domain has its own timeline and we care about the timelines for the Human and Robot components.

A timeline is represented with a `List<DecisionVariable>`, in the case of the Human and Robot components, each `DecisionVariable` represents a task. We can finally know what the task is by calling `task.getValue()` and parsing the string that this method returns.

As an example, let's say that the task we're currently parsing has the following (String) value: `PickPlace-foam-low-chest-regular`. This means that the task is a Pick & Place operation, which is the most common in HRC environments. The following set of values specifies the parameters of this task, which respectively indicate `target`, `intrinsic risk`, `trajectory`, and `speed` of the Pick & Place. 

We will elaborate on these parameters later, what matters is how our implementation parses this value into structured and useful data.
Each of the relevant parameters of a task exists inside our implementation as a Java Enum class, which contain the static pre-compiled values that are associated to each value of the parameter. 

```java
public enum GeometricRisk {  
	legs(  riskValue: 0.2, ...),  
	chest( riskValue: 0.4, ...),  
	head(  riskValue: 0.7, ...),  
	none(  riskValue:   0, ...);
	
	//...
}
```

We parse the string we get from PLATINUm into a set of parameters represented by Enums. In order to do this we split the string on every occurrence of the `-` character and then instantiate the Enum class using the static `valueOf(str)` method. Here's an example:

After every parameter has been parsed into the appropriate class, they are all stored inside a class that represents the whole task. Here's an example of the system:

```java
public RobotTaskRisk(String tokenValue, ...) {  
	//...
	// tokenValue: "PickPlace-foam-low-chest-regular"
	String[] splits = tokenValue.split("-"); 
	//...
	this.geometricRisk = GeometricRisk.valueOf(splits[3]);
	//...
}
```

In our example, the `chest` parameter gets parsed into `GeometricRisk.chest` and we now have access to the risk value associated to this parameter. The same is done with the other parameters and everything is stored inside the `RobotTaskRisk` class.

This makes it very easy to parse a simple string into structured and useful data that we can use to compute risk and makespan related properties.
