## Building on top of PLATINUm
### PLATINUm's architecture
As stated earlier, and in [[Timeline-based planning and execution with uncertainty. Theory, modeling methodologies and practice]], PLATINUm is a general-purpose framework for planning and execution with timelines under uncertainty, which implements a hierarchical solving procedure.
The PLATINUm framework has a layered architecture, which consists of two main components: the Representation Framework and the Problem Solving component.
The Representation Framework is responsible for representing the planning domain and problem in a structured manner. It consists of a plan database that stores information about the planning domain, such as state variables, decomposition rules, and synchronization rules. The plan database is structured in such a way that it can support hierarchical modeling of timeline-based domains.
The Problem Solving component is responsible for generating plans that satisfy the given planning goals. It consists of a planner that uses search heuristics to leverage the hierarchical structure of the planning domain during plan generation. The planner is capable of dealing with temporal uncertainty during plan generation by leveraging information about the temporal uncertainty of the planning domain.
The Problem Solving component works in conjunction with the Representation Framework to support hierarchical modeling and solving of timeline-based planning problems under uncertainty. The planner uses the information stored in the plan database, such as state variables, decomposition rules, and synchronization rules. The final 
The Planner's aim is to synthesize a set of operations that, given an initial state, allow the system to reach a desired goal state. The reasoning process relies on a model which represents a general description of the problem to solve. The model provides a representation of the environment in terms of the possible states of the world and the actions the system can perform to interact with the environment.
